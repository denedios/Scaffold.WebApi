# API Documentation #

In a microservices environment, other developers (or stakeholders) may be wondering what your Web API does and how to use it. Scaffold.WebApi helps improves the developer experience in this aspect by including API documentation in the actual Web API service. Scaffold.WebApi uses a package call [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) to help generate and expose documentation about the Web API in the [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](https://www.openapis.org/) format. When running the Web API, you can view this documentation by going to the `/swagger` endpoint of the WebAPI. For example `http://localhost:5000/swagger`.
